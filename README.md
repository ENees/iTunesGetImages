Transfers the Artwork of all Mediaitems in iTunes to the Files "Folder.jpg"

You can use the code to retrieve the artwork of mediaitems in order to store it as file in the same Folder as the media is located, if the file does not exists yet. The file will be named Folder.jpg (Folder.png). I used it to generate the files for my NAS (Diskstation)
